        <p>My dearest butterfly Jessie 🦋, </p>
        <p>Happy Birthday! 🎉 The world may <abbr title="يفيض">overflow</abbr> with butterflies, each <abbr title="يرفرف">fluttering</abbr> with beauty, but you, my friend, are a sight unlike any other. You're the butterfly with wings woven from <abbr title="غبار النجوم">stardust</abbr>, a rare and precious treasure that lights up my world. ✨</p>
        <p>Deep within you lies a universe of emotions, a <abbr title="كالياسكوب">kaleidoscope</abbr> of feelings hidden beneath your seemingly calm <abbr title="الخارجي">exterior</abbr>. Sometimes, your heart might feel like a <abbr title="مهترئ">weathered</abbr> stone, carrying <abbr title="أعباء">burdens</abbr> unseen. But <abbr title=" I could see you make me want you even more ">"I Can See You"</abbr>. I see the true you – a <abbr title="رقيق">tender</abbr> heart, a <abbr title="Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share">"Delicate"</abbr> gem waiting to unfold its <abbr title="مشرق">radiant</abbr> wings. It shines with a soft, inner light, a light of kindness and empathy that warms everyone it touches. 💖</p>
        <p>You are my rock, my <abbr title="مرساة">anchor</abbr>, even when the storms of life rage between us. We may fight like butterflies with tangled wings, feathers ruffled and voices loud, but even in our disagreements, our bond remains <abbr title="ثابت">constant</abbr>. Because deep down, we know this: across every universe, in every possible reality, my love for you remains <abbr title="أبدية">constant</abbr>, we are <abbr title="I'll love you 'til the day that I die">Birds Of A feather </abbr>, a love as fierce and endless as the ocean. 🌊</p>
        <p>Yes, sometimes your anger <abbr title="يومض">flickers</abbr> like a shooting star, a fleeting moment that leaves a trail of silence in its wake. There are times when your quiet feels like a <abbr title="شاسع">vast</abbr>, lonely sea, leaving me lost in the unknown. But just like a <abbr title="يرقة">caterpillar</abbr> waits patiently within its <abbr title="شرنقة">chrysalis</abbr>, I know there's a <abbr title="تحول">metamorphosis</abbr> waiting to happen within you. And no matter how long it takes, I'll be here, your loyal penguin 🐧, by your side, waiting for you to <abbr title="يظهر">emerge</abbr>, your wings <abbr title="متلألئ">glistening</abbr> with renewed strength.</p>
        <p>You already know I love you, but maybe you don't know the depth of it. My love for you is a universe of stars, each one brighter than the last. It's a love that knows no bounds, no anger, no sadness that can truly dim its light. It's a love that whispers your name in every beat of my heart, a love written in the <abbr title="الكوكبات">constellations</abbr> and sung by the stars. 🌟</p>
        <p>Happy Birthday, my precious butterfly. May this coming year be filled with joy that sets your wings aflutter, with laughter that fills the air like the sweetest melody, and with sunshine that warms your soul. And remember, no matter how dimmed your inner light feels, I'll always be here, your lighthouse in the storm, guiding you back to the warmth and love that awaits you. Just like <abbr title="Weird but fuckin' beautiful">Snow On The Beach</abbr> 🕯️</p>
        <p>With all the love in my heart (and more than words can express!), I was <abbr title="My thoughts will echo your name">Enchanted</abbr> to meet you. </p>
        <p>Your penguin who cherishes you more than you know, <abbr title="Your Penguin">BoshEee</abbr></p>
